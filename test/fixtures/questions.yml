#Ethics and Legal Compliance

  question_type: Text
  guidance: "<p class='guidance_header'>Questions to consider:</p> <ul> <li>Have you gained consent for data preservation and sharing?</li> <li>How will you protect the identity of participants if required? e.g. via anonymisation</li> <li>How will sensitive data be handled to ensure it is stored and transferred securely?</li> </ul> <p class='guidance_header'>Guidance:</p> <p>Ethical issues affect how you store data, who can see/use it and how long it is kept. Managing ethical concerns may include: anonymisation of data; referral to departmental or institutional ethics committees; and formal consent agreements. You should show that you are aware of any issues and have planned accordingly. If you are carrying out research involving human participants, you must also ensure that consent is requested to allow data to be shared and reused.</p>"

#Storage and Backup

  text: How will the data be stored and backed up during the research?
  question_type: Text
  guidance: "<p class='guidance_header'>Questions to consider:</p> <ul> <li>Do you have sufficient storage or will you need to include charges for additional services?</li> <li>How will the data be backed up?</li> <li>Who will be responsible for backup and recovery?</li> <li>How will the data be recovered in the event of an incident?</li> </ul> <p class='guidance_header'>Guidance: </p> <p>State how often the data will be backed up and to which locations. How many copies are being made? Storing data on laptops, computer hard drives or external storage devices alone is very risky. The use of robust, managed storage provided by university IT teams is preferable. Similarly, it is normally better to use automatic backup services provided by IT Services than rely on manual processes. If you choose to use a third-party service, you should ensure that this does not conflict with any funder, institutional, departmental or group policies, for example in terms of the legal jurisdiction in which data are held or the protection of sensitive data.</p>"

Decide which data to keep and for how long. This could be based on any obligations to retain certain data, the potential reuse value, what is economically viable to keep, and any additional effort required to prepare the data for data sharing and preservation.
