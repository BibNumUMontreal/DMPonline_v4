    title: "About DMPonline"
    body_text_html: "<div class='white_background'>
    <p>Funding bodies increasingly require their grant-holders to produce Data Management Plans(DMP), both during the bid-preparation stage and after funding has been secured. DMPonline has been produced by the UK's Digital Curation Centre to help research teams respond to this requirement, and any expectations that their institution or others may apply.</p>
    <p>The <a href='http://www.dcc.ac.uk/' target='_blank'>DCC</a> has worked closely with research funders and universities to produce a tool that assists researchers to produce an effective data management plan (DMP) to cater for the whole lifecycle of a project, from bid-preparation stage through to completion.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>How the tool works</h3>
    <div class='white_background'>
    <p>There are a number of templates within the tool that represent the requirements of different funders and institutions. Users are asked three questions at the outset so we can determine the appropriate template to display (e.g. the ESRC template when applying for an ESRC grant). Guidance is provided to help you interpret and answer the questions. This guidance is provided by researcher funders, universities and disciplines.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    <div class='white_background'>
    <p>If you have an account please sign in and start creating or editing your DMP.</p>
    <p>If you do not have a DMPonline account, click on <a href='/'>'Sign up'</a> on the homepage.</p>
    <p>Please visit the <a href='/help'>'Help'</a> page for guidance.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Additional Information</h3>
    <div class='white_background'>
    <p>We are constantly improving the user interface and functionality of DMPonline. If you would like to contribute with feedback and suggestions, please contact us by emailing <a href='mailto:dmponline@dcc.ac.uk?Subject=DMPonline%20inquiry' target='_top'>dmponline@dcc.ac.uk</a>.</p></div>"

    <p>When you login to DMPonline you will be directed to the 'My plans' page. From here you can edit, share, export or delete any of your plans. You will also see plans that have been shared with you by others.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Create a plan</h3>
    <div class='white_background'>
    <p>To create a plan, click the 'Create plan' button from the 'My plans' page or  the top menu. Select options from the drop-down menus and tickboxes to determine what questions and guidance you should be presented with. Confirm your selection by clicking 'Yes, create plan'</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Write your plan</h3>
    <div class='white_background'>
    <p>The tabbed interface allows you to navigate through different functions when editing your plan.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>- 'Plan details' includes basic administrative details, tells you what sets of questions and guidance your plan is based on and gives you an overview to the questions that you will be asked.</li>
      <li>- The following tab(s) present the questions to answer. There may be more than one tab if your funder or university asks different sets of questions at different stages e.g. at grant application and post-award.</li>
      <li>- The 'Share' tab allows you to invite others to read or contribute to your plan.</li>
      <li>- The 'Export' tab allows you to download your plan in various formats. This may be useful if you need to submit your plan as part of a grant application.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When viewing any of the question tabs, you will see the different sections of your plan displayed. Click into these in turn to answer the questions. You can format your responses using the text editing buttons.</p>
    <p>Guidance is displayed in the right-hand panel. Click the '+' symbol to view this.</p> 
    <p>Remember to 'save' your responses before moving on.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Share plans</h3>
    <div class='white_background'>

    <p>If desired, you can leave a note to explain what you would like collaborators to look at. You can remove access or update the level of permissions granted at any time.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Export plans</h3>
    <div class='white_background'>
    <p>From here you can download your plan in various formats. This may be useful if you need to submit your plan as part of a grant application. Choose what format you would like to view/download your plan in and click to export. When you login to DMPonline you will be directed to the 'My plans' page. From here you can edit, share, export or delete any of your plans. You will also see plans that have been shared with you by others.</p></div>"
